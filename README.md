# TingaTingGroup Project
#### TingaTing website
#### Created By

An initiative called TingTinga uses modern technologies to give farmers access to farm mechanization. One of these is its web-based platforms, which let farmers place individual or group service orders using handheld electronic devices like laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. Due to this accessibility, even small-scale farmers can lease farming equipment for a limited time. Farmers can register for mechanized services through existing established organizations suchÂ as NGOs, Chama, SACCOs, Co-operative Societies, or Churches using the TingaTing Community Model Concept.
